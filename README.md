This repository provides how we generate an Arabic questions dataset from a few questions for the ChatBot system uses and other purposes.

 Generally, there are lack of resources for the Arabic datasets. So, it is difficult to find an appropriate dataset for using in data science and machine learning field. In this repository we tried to solve this problem by creating a new dataset contains an Arabic questions can be used for the Chatbot and other purposes.
 
 The repository contains several files that displayed the steps of building the dataset and processing it to be suitable for used in the machine learning and data science fields.

The files as follow:
1. Dataset: contains the dataset before and after generating the questions.
